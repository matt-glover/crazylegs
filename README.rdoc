Crazylegs is a *very* small library to sign urls for two-legged OAuth.  This will not request urls for you, it will not parse a response for you, it will not give you some crazy DSL to abstract away the details.  It *will* properly sign a URL using a consumer key and secret so that you can make an OAuth request for 2-legged auth.  That's it.

== Use

Install if you need to:

    gem install crazylegs

== Example

    include Crazylegs
    credentials = Credentials.new(consumer_key,shared_secret)
    url = SignedURL.new(credentials,"http://scrapi-demo-dev.opower.com/api/customers",'GET')
    url['accountNumber'] = '655321'
    signed_url = url.full_url
    # signed_url can now be requested of the remote server

See Crazylegs::SignedURL and Crazylegs::Credentials for more info.

=== Seeing WTF is going on

    logger = Logger.new(STDERR)
    logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
    url = SignedURL.new(credentials,"http://scrapi-demo-dev.opower.com/api/customers",'GET',logger)
